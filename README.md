# My Software Portfolio
These are a few examples of features I've built or played a major role in building.

## k8s_cloud_build
A PoC to auto-deploy to Google Kubernetes Engine using Google Cloud Build triggered by git tags and pushes.

## led_projects
This is various C code from different personal art projects with LEDs.

## migrations
Google App Engine Flex container app written with Flask, RabbitMQ, and Celery to run custom Google Cloud Dataflow pipelines. Also contains a helper library I wrote to make common tasks easier. NOTE Dataflow mapper classes were written by a colleague and added to by me.
